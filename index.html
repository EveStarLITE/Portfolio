          Am I a child? Yes- But thats not forever as I will be 18 in two years.
          The goal is to have a job before then but if not that gives me 2 years to further
          improve my skills and get more hand on experiance through my robotics team and personal fun.
          All is fine-

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I started programming in mid summer 2021. Not that long ago at all but in that 
        short time I have come a long way. From not understanding basic syntax in c++  
        to now being ready to help out my team in our upcoming build season!

      </p>
      <p>
        Now am I 100% job ready? No! No one really is as a jr dev. You just kind of 
        have to start. And I want to hit the ground running-

      </p>
      <p>
        Web development is intresting and I capable of doing it. You are seeing proof of it- 
        and I love robotics focoused software but I've been studing Android mobile development
        I'm close to taking the Google certification. I just need money for the exam fee.
        Paradoxicly- needing a job to get the certification to get a job :\

      <div class="skills-wrapper">
        <div class="first-set animate__animated animate__pulse">
          <img
            src="assets/Icons/C++.png"
            alt=""
            loading="lazy"
            class="icon icon-card"
          />
          <img
            src="assets/Icons/Git_icon.png"
            alt=""
            loading="lazy"
            class="icon icon-card"
          />
          <img
            src="assets/Icons/Google.png"
            alt=""
            loading="lazy"
            class="icon icon-card"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now I only know Git and C++ Because I'm in robotics where I get FIRST hand 
        experiance with both. Though again- build season has not started yet I feel 
        very confidant in my ability to use those two. And soon Python and Java!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now google- I would not be where I am without it. None of us would be if 
        we're being honest. You don't just learn how to make a nice looking website
        in an hour without the endless resources avalible. I turely believe my 
        willingness to say "I don't know" and look it up will take me much farther 
        than i could have gone otherwise
